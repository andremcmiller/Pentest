Burp Suite Pro 2023.2.1 + Burp Bounty Professional 2.6.2 (pwn3rzs repack)
web testing and bug bounty hunting software for manual httpcraft


NOTES

PROPER CREDIT as usual on this release goes to h3110w0r1d-y for their BurpLoaderKeygen.jar,
which is based on and credits the work of x-Ai, surferxyz, and googleweb for original and major
contributions.  Several others in our small scene have rebranded this keygen as their own.
h3110w0r1d wrote this "The core patch code and number calculation code are not written by
me. The cracking solution in version 1.9 of this project comes from the big guy @googleweb. I
just integrated the Loader and Keygen of the big guys into one and added some small functions
for easy use."  Indeed this person has done an excellent job and there were only a few Burp
versions where I (zen) filled in the gaps with a mod, but most of the time the updates are
on-the-spot and there is no mod needed for this to work so credit goes to these guys.

This is just a repack of the right files to get it all going.  If you couldn't figure this
out for yourself then maybe you shouldn't be using BurpSuite... but this is also a bundle for
convenience.  Also, if you use the software we provide for any benefit especially for profit
you should definitely pay for a legit copy.  By supporting the software authors you help
ensure future updates that benefit all of us.


INSTRUCTIONS

1. have Java 17+ installed properly, I tested Win version. Each of the below has Linux/Mac
   and any of these should work fine.  None require login like java.com does.
   https://adoptium.net/ (java 17)
   https://www.techspot.com/downloads/7440-java-se-17.html
   https://www.techspot.com/downloads/2017-java-jdk-18.html
   https://www.techspot.com/downloads/7508-java-19.html
   https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/ (java 17, java 19 will say warning but still works)
   also on debian/ubuntu you can use  `sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk openjdk-17-jre`
     if you need to select between multiple java installed: `update-java-alternatives --list`
     then `sudo update-java-alternatives --set /path/to/java/version` (change the path)
   or on redat/fedora/centos use this `sudo dnf install -y java-17-openjdk-devel java-17-openjdk`
     if you didn't uninstall an older java first, `sudo alternatives --config java`

2. Choose a place for your Burp install like c:\burpsuite\ and put BurpLoaderKeygen.jar there
   Doubleclick BurpLoaderKeygen.jar to run it
   BurpLoaderKeygen.jar checks the latest available JAR download and tells you
   AT THE TIME OF THIS RELEASE it will be the jar that is included, so it will say no update.
   (Later, as new versions come out, it will show them and you can click to download - make sure
   you put the jar in the same directory)

3. In BurpLoaderKeygen, you may optionally replace the registration name as you like
   If you screw this up, you can use the included reset scripts to clear it and start over.

4. use the BurpLoaderKeygen to run BurpSuitePro by clicking the run button.
   Burp will run and show a license agreement. Click agree.  It will then ask for a license,
   which you copy/paste from the keygen which is still open in the background.
   (click on license text, ctl-a, ctl-c, click on burp license box, ctl-v to paste)
   click next
   click manual activation
   click copy request
   go back to keygen and paste into the request box on the right side, it will produce
     an activation response.  Copy/paste that back to Burp. (click c-a c-c click c-v)
   click next  (success!)
   click finish
   click next
   click start burp

5. now that BurpSuite Pro is licensed and running, let's set up burp bounty.
   Click on Extensions tab near top right
   click on Add
   It will default to type Java, so click on "Select file.." to the right of jar field
   navigate to burpbounty folder and select BurpBountyPro.jar and click open, then next, close
   now there is a new tab in top right of burpsuite called "Burp Bounty Pro". click it
   in the red license key field, type the text "zer0daylab is a scam" then click activate
   NOTE that the rules and profiles tabs are empty. here is how to fix it.
   in the second row of tabs from the top there is an options tab, click it
   at the top for Burp Bounty Data click the Directory button and navigate back to the burpbounty
     directory and the subdirector "BurpBountyData" and when in that folder click "open"
   now when you click the tabs for "rules" "profiles" etc you will see some stuff!

6. for usage beyond this, there are many books and videos/courses, plus portswigger has training.
